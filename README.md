Goal: 
  - Implement 2 modes (Calibration and Playing) via a switch
  - CALIBRATION MODE: 
      - Flashes an LED to indicate when the calibration starts
      - Each time the user presses the button, the time is recorded in an array and the number of flips increases
      - The user must indicate how many pages of sheet music they have
      - Once the calibration is complete, tell the user by lighting up an LED and printing a message to the Serial
  - PLAYING MODE:
      - Flip the pages according to the elapsed times collected from the calibration
      - Flash the LED at each of these times
